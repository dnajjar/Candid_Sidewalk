Dear Council Member <%= @incident.get_name %>,<br><br>

Our districtâ€™s streets are in dire need of repair. Potholes and  uneven <br> sidwalks are a hazard to our local population, as well as a major barrier <br> for people with disabilities. <br><br>

The image below was taken at <%= @incident.reverse_geocode %>,<br> in this district. Our community deserves safe, repaired streets. Please fix <br> this road, to prevent injury and increase the wellbeing of your constituents. <br>
