# Candid_Sidewalk

Candid Sidewalk is a Rails app that allows users to report hazardous sidewalks to their local councilperson in one click of their smart phone.  

Its responsive mobile design works across platforms (Android, iPhone, and Desktop browser) to capture a photograph with geolocation metadata and email the photo with its address to the Councilperson who represents that area.
